Hi there! People on the internet know me under the alias Trobonox, or short, Trobo. I love experimenting and discovering new technologies that I can use for building fun projects.
I have been programming small tools and Discord Bots in Python for around 4 years, but also recently started exploring the world of Front End Web Development with JavaScript (TypeScript), HTML and CSS.

If you want to contact me, you can write me an email at hello@trobo.tech or add me on Discord: Trobonox#2680.
